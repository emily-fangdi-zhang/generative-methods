## Describe each of the four GIFs

1. The first one captures the inside/underground view of a construction side with tunnels and things going through them.
2. The second one captures rain drops that is colorful and animated.
3. The third one captures the hand movements when someone is wiping the windshield.
4. The fourth one captures rain drops in a "The Giver" way, different from the previous one in style.
5. The fifth one captures my love of orange through mosaic vibrations.
6. The sixth one captures air particle movements when slashing through air.

## What P5 method or technique did you enjoy using the most? What was interesting to you about it?

I used draw the most because it was the most crucial: I could not have created anything without it. The most interesting thing
about it is how if variables are defined or called upon correctly, I can get no pictures or overlapping pictures. This was how
I was able to draw my tunneling gif!

## Did you find any P5 functionality that wasn't covered in class?

Since I sampled from Professor Compton's code, I didn't use any functionality that wasn't covered in class. I found some
functionality online that wasn't covered in class, but they were too difficult for me to incorporate and understand.

## How did you get your looping gif to loop smoothly? What was hard or easy about that techinque?

I got the looping gif to loop smoothly because I sampled from Professor Compton's code. Additionally, I added a loop
so that the movement of the circles would appear smoother. The hard part of this technique is figuering out the x and y
values so that the movement is not too fast or slow. The easy part of this technique is that it required little debugging
since the professor already gave us the outline.
