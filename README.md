# Ollie's World

Ollie's World is a simple website dedicated to tell Ollie's life story.
The Woof button alerts the user that Ollie says hi. The links take the user to Emily Zhang's
GitHub and Glitch profiles respectively.

Enjoy Ollie's photo diary!

## What's in this project?

← `README.md`: That's this file, where I can tell people what Ollie's World looks like and how I built it.

← `index.html`: This is the main HTML page for my site: the structural framework of the page.

← `style.css`: CSS files add styling rules to the content, allowing the page look nice and green!

← `script.js`: Since I am feeling fancy, I added interactivity to the site with JavaScript. This is how Ollie says hi!
